# Project Description
This project explores dimensionality reduction techniques by comparing unsupervised and supervised methods. In this projejct I build and evaluate a standard dense autoencoder to visualize low-dimensional features and reconstructions, assessing their discriminative power. Following this, I train a supervised autoencoder and repeat the evaluation to compare the effectiveness of the supervised approach in learning more discriminative features.
